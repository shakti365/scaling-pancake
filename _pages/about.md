Hello World! I am a ML Engineer working on finding solutions with Machine Learning for real-world problems. My mission is to solve learning to act problems using AI.

Currently, I build ML products at [CustomerGlu](https://customerglu.com). Most of my work revolves around looking at latest research and finding a way to apply them in our product. I love engineering solutions to hard problems independent of domain, that is why I shuffle around backend and data engineering when its required.

I am interested in key topics related to Deep Reinforcement Learning, Constrained Optimization and Causal Inference. Particulary, application of Deep RL to real-world problems like robotics excites me.

Often, you will find me reading books, listening to podcasts or cooking.
