Hello World! I am a ML Engineer working on finding solutions to real-world problems using Machine Learning.

My day job involves streamlining and scaling ML solutions at [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com). Previously, I was a founding team member at [CustomerGlu](https://customerglu.com) where I built ML infrastructure for SaaS products.

I am interested in key topics related to Deep Reinforcement Learning, Constrained Optimization and Causal Inference. Particulary, application of RL to real-world decision making excites me.

Often, you will find me taking long walks listening to podcasts.
