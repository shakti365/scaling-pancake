Hello World! I am a ML Engineer working on finding solutions with Machine Learning for real-world problems.
My mission is to solve learning to act problems (like planning and optimization) using AI.

I am interested in key topics related to Deep Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algortihms 
and Causal Inference. I have also done some work in domains like Computer Vision and NLP.

At times I like building things using web technologies like Tornado and NodeJS. Also, I know my way around data processing systems
like Spark and Kafka.

You can find me lurking around Reddit, HN and Twitter. And when not doing that, listening to podcasts, cooking or reading Star Wars Wookieepedia, I am.
