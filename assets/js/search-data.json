My mission is to solve learning to act problems (like planning and optimization) using AI. . I am interested in key topics related to Deep Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algortihms and Causal Inference. I have also done some work in domains like Computer Vision and NLP. . At times I like building things using web technologies like Tornado and NodeJS. Also, I know my way around data processing systems like Spark and Kafka. . You can find me lurking around Reddit, HN and Twitter. And when not doing that, listening to podcasts, cooking or reading Star Wars Wookieepedia, I am. .",
